- Mechs individual components can over heat as well as it's energy core from various over uses.
- Maneuvers or attacks cause heat to the extension and/or component 
- Energy Core breach
- Charge up capacitor for 'limit-breaks'
- 'Shield connection' - It takes a minimum amount of energy to create the initial shield bubble, though once created it can hold with less energy (like  a fan power switch going to high first so turning on and over initial coming momentum).
	- This means if you lose your shields you need to use the capacitor to re-enable it.
- EMP disables shields, and if you don't have shields, it shuts down your computer
	- Shut down computer means you lose a turn rebooting
	- You cannot use your EMP if your shields aren't at a minimum strength, or you'll shut down your own computer - which isn't allowed.
